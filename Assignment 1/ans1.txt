Lab Questions - Assignment 1

1.  Using the hint, I first commanded:
	$ man man
    and inspected the options.  From here, I find the command:
	$ man -k string
    returns all the commands that have the word string in the description in
    their man pages.

2.  I find the programs using the which command:
	$ which mv sh
    and it outputs the location of the programs in the directory:
	/usr/local/cs/bin/mv
    for the program mv, and for the program sh:
	/usr/local/cs/bin/sh

3.  To search for programs, I use the find command and search within /bin,
    which is the folder for executable programs:
	$ find /usr/bin -name "?r"
    which outputs three results:
	/usr/bin/tr
	/usr/bin/ar
	/usr/bin/pr
    therefore there are 3.

4.  In order to find the files associated with emacs, I navigate into the folder
	$ cd /usr/bin
    and then search for all files with including the name emacs
	$ ls -l | grep emacs
    which displays the symbolic link to /etc/alternatives/emacs.

5.  After prepending the path variable to the beginning of my path
	$ export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
    I check the two versions of gcc
	$ gcc --version
    which tells me gcc is running version 8.2.0, compared to
	$ /usr/bin/gcc --version
    which gives version 4.8.5.  I then investigate the gcc command:
	$ which gcc
    which tells me gcc really points to /usr/local/cs/bin/gcc, which isn't /usr/bin/gcc.
    They are different programs because /usr/bin/gcc is an older archived version, but
    /usr/local/cs/bin/gcc is a new version installed on my Seasnet.

6.  Since '+' denotes a permission being allowed and a '-' restricted,
    the chmod u+sx,o-w does two things:
    	1) changes user's permissions to allowing execution and giving the user
	   the same level of access as the owner.
	2) Restricts write permissions for others'.

7.  In order to find the correct find option
	$ man find
    where I learn that I want to use the option -mtime n for n*24 hours ago and
    that we want to specify the search as type directory:
	$ find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime 28
    for 28*24 hours ago, which equates to 4 weeks ago.  The command returned nothing
    so no directories have been modified in the last 4 weeks.

8.  In order to find the files associated with emacs, I navigate into the folder
	$ cd /usr/bin
    and then search for all files that are symbolic links by using grep to find all
    the files that begin with l, which signifies a file type link. I command this
    with a wc to tally the number of matches.
	$ ls -l | grep ^l | wc
    which outputs 280 and :
	lrwxrwxrwx    1 root root          52 Jan  2 15:41 allcm -> /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/scripts/tetex/allcm.sh
	lrwxrwxrwx    1 root root           5 Jan  2 15:41 allec -> allcm
	lrwxrwxrwx    1 root root          56 Jan  2 15:41 allneeded -> /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/scripts/tetex/allneeded.sh
	lrwxrwxrwx    1 root root          30 Jan  2 15:55 appletviewer -> /etc/alternatives/appletviewer
	lrwxrwxrwx    1 root root           6 Jan  2 15:51 apropos -> whatis
	lrwxrwxrwx    1 root root           5 Jan  2 15:45 arecord -> aplay
	lrwxrwxrwx    1 root root           2 Jan  2 15:50 atq -> at
	lrwxrwxrwx    1 root root           2 Jan  2 15:50 atrm -> at
	lrwxrwxrwx    1 root root           4 Sep 15  2017 awk -> gawk
	lrwxrwxrwx    1 root root          10 Jan  2 15:39 bashbug -> bashbug-64
	...

9.  First I navigate to the correct directory
	$ cd /usr/lib64
    and then I search all the files in order sorted by time
	$ ls -lt
    and scroll to the bottom of the list.  The last file is:
	librom1394.so.0.3.0

10. I begin by inspecting the locale command
	$ man locale
    which describes that locale retrieves its data from the environment variables describing
    the current locale settings.
	
11. First I open emacs by using the command:
	$ emacs
    and then I use the get-help function and select a for PATTERN,
    then search the commands by keyword downcase:
	C-h a downcase
    which returns 2 commands:
	downcase-region	C-x C-l
	downcase-word	M-l

12. Similarily, I open emacs by using the command:
	$ emacs
    and then I use the get-help function and select c for CODING,
    then search the commands by keystroke starting at C-M-r down to C-M-v:
	C-h c C-M-r
		(C-M-r	runs the command isearch-backward-regexp)
	C-h c C-M-s
		(C-M-s	runs the command isearch-forward-regrexp)
	C-h c C-M-t
		(C-M-t	runs the command transpose-sexps)
	C-h c C-M-u
		(C-M-u	runs the command backward-up-list)
	C-h c C-M-v
		(C-M-v	runs the command scroll-other-window)

13.  I open emacs:
	$ emacs
     then use the get-help function and select c for CODING, then
     search the command C-g:
	C-h c C-g
		(C-g	runs the command keyboard-quit)
     In order to explore the command in more detail, I use the get-help
     function again, but this time select f for FUNCTION:
	C-h f keyboard-quit Enter
		(Keyboard-quit is an interactive compiled Lisp function.
		 It is bound to C-g.
		 Signal a 'quit' condition.
		 During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a
		 quit directly.  At top-level, as an editor command, this
		 simply beeps.)

14.  I open emacs:
	$ emacs
     then use the get-help function and select f for FUNCTION:
	C-h f yank Enter
		(yank is bound to C-y)
		(reinserts the most recent kill, which is the stretch of killed
		 text most recently killed OR yanked.)

15.  To compare the two, I run the first shell command:
	$ ls -l
		total 96

		-rw-r--r-- 1 adamc ceugrad  2153 Jan 12 19:08 key1.txt
     To see the second one, I open emacs
	$ emacs
     and run the directory listing of the dired command
	C-x d ~/35L/A1 Enter
		/u/ce/ugrad/adamc/35L/A1:
  		total used in directory 104 available 368820672
  		drwxr-xr-x 3 adamc ceugrad  4096 Jan 12 17:37 .

  		-rw-r--r-- 1 adamc ceugrad  2153 Jan 12 19:08 key1.txt
	The difference between the two is that the emacs directory listing
	also lists the directories that the files are within ( . and .. )
	(their roots) and the times they were edited, etc.
