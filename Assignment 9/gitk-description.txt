gitk-description.txt


In the gitk window that pops up after running
	$ gitk
in the ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs repository, there are three subwindows that appear.


The top subwindow contains an ordered list of all the commits made to the
master branch of GNU Emacs.  Icons appear next to the commit names to create
a visualization of an actual branch.  In this subwindow there are three columns.
First, the name of the commit.  The second column holds the name and email of
the commiter, and the third column holds the time the commit was made.

The bottom-right subwindow allows you to choose what to view on the bottom-left
subwindow.  If tree is chosen, the entire emacs repository is displayed, and any
files you select will appear on the bottom-left subwindow.  The comments for this
commit will be shown by default.

If patch is chosen, the bottom-left subwindow displays the patch used to update the
master branch by the committer. The bottom-right window will allow you to navigate
to the main sections of the patch: the changelog, and the diff headings for each
file modified in the patch.
