The ls command now aligns with the other Linux tag standards, where any
subsequent tag should overwrite any previous tags if they overlap 
functionality.  In this case, ls becomes standardized.  Discussing time
efficiency, the ls -aA command removed an 
	if (ignore_mode == IGNORE_DEFAULT)
            ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT;
any replaces it with only
	ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT;
So, the time efficiency should improve since the if() comparison is avoided
and will always set the condition instead of testing first.

Since the patch only changes the functionality of ls, if my company adopted
the patched version of Coreutils, I would watch out for any function / code
that included the ls command.  Since it was changed, trusting ls to work as
before could lead to unforseen consequences.

When running randline.py on the empty file /dev/null, it returns an index error
because the randline.py file operates with the total number of lines in the
file, which is 0 in the /dev/null file.

When randline.py is compiled with python3, it returns a syntax error.  The
error comes from the line:
	 File "randline.py", line 65
	    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
	                      ^
	SyntaxError: invalid syntax
This syntax is valid for python2, but when compiled in python3 it is incorrect.
In python3, it should be written as:
	except IOError as err:
